**`Data Analyst/Data Scientist`**

I'm a senior at Marquette University majoring in Biomedical Sciences with a passion for exploring the intersection of data science and healthcare. Currently, I am working towards a minor in Data Science, aiming to complement my multidisciplinary background with advanced analytical and computational skills. Over the past year, I've been actively engaged in diverse projects that harness the power of machine learning and predictive modeling concepts. Specifically, my focus has revolved around the implementation of classification and regression trees to develop predictive models. I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on interdisciplinary projects that address real-world challenges, particularly in the realm of healthcare innovation.
